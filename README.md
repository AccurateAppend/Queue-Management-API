# Queue-Management-API
The Accurate Append management API is a set of APIs to be toolkit to facilitate advanced integration with our appending services, billing, and processing. It is designed using RESTful endpoints as well as HTTP facilities to allow programmatic access to submit files for batch appending.

```
These APIs are only available for our active subscription clients and can not
be used with a trial key. Accounts that only use our appending apis and do not
submit files for batch processing do not need to integrate with these endpoints.
